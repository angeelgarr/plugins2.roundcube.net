You\u2019ll need to also run a local oxd OpenID Connect client service. The oxd middleware service is easy to install, and makes it easier to keep up-to-date with the latest security fixes for OAuth2. There are oxd plugins, modules and extennsions for many popular platforms and frameworks like: Wordpress, Magento, OpenCart, SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, Drupal, Roundcube, Spring Framework, Play Framework, Ruby on Rails and Python Flask. Using this plugin, you\u2019ll be able to request a certain type of authentication using the OpenID Connect \u201cacr\u201d parameter. You may want to use strong two-factor authentication (2FA), or social login to Google, Facebook or other popular sites. Also supported is Super Gluu--a free mobile two factor authentication app. If you are also looking for a modern access management platform, you should consider the Gluu Server Community Edition.
